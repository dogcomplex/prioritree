A Resource can refer to the string, array or object representation of a resource in the system.
	As such, any "Resource" class would probably be abstract(?) 
This is distinct from a Service, which is always the object representation of a resource. 

$value = Resource::of($value) might be a way to validate that $value is in fact a string, array or object pointer to a valid resource.  (or null, if invalid)

whereas $value = Service::of($value) would always return an object (or possibly null, if invalid)
